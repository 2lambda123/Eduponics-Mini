# Supported frameworks

Currently we 100% support MicroPython and we also partially support ESP-IDF. We hope to add more support to more frameworks and programming languages later on.
We highly suggest to use MicroPython as the main programming framework for your Eduponics Mini as we cannot assure we will be able to assist with other frameworks or programming languages.
